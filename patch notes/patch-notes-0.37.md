## [EMF] Entity Model Features [Fabric & Forge]
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features)

### Forge - 1.20.1 - 2.2.6
*   fixed model textures prefixed with `./` & `~/` breaking from a recent change
*   expanded the EMF API:
    *   added `int getCurrentEMFVariantOfModel(EntityModel<?>)` returns the current variant of the model or -1 if the model is not a custom EMF model.
    *   added `boolean isModelAnimatedByEMF(EntityModel<?>)` returns true if the model has custom EMF animations.
    *   added `boolean isModelCustomizedByEMF(EntityModel<?>)` returns true if the model is a custom EMF model.
    *   added `boolean isModelPartCustomToEMF(ModelPart)` returns true if this model part is an extraneous part added by EMF, and does not represent any actual normal vanilla parts.
    *   added `boolean isModelPartAnimatedByEMF(ModelPart)` returns true if this model part itself is animated by EMF, e.g `"modePart.rx":"sin(age)"`.
*   fixed some per-entity model override settings from not applying correctly in game, such as modifying render mode per entity type.
*   moved the box face UV height/width are zero warnings to only appear when model creation logging is enabled, as it got far too spammy with the many packs that don't care about this.

### Forge - 1.20.6 - 2.2.5
*   fixed a crash when arrows render stuck inside a player with a custom model that replaced all their vanilla parts
*   fixed arrows stuck inside players not following with the custom animations of the custom player model
*   EMF now removes the `floor UVs` OptiFine parity setting in 1.21 and newer versions, as OptiFine now matches EMF's default behaviour.
*   The warning for a cube having 0 UV width and height has been made more verbose, and will also be dependent on the `floor UVs` setting in earlier versions.

*   fixed a crash when arrows render stuck inside a player with a custom model that replaced all their vanilla parts
*   fixed arrows stuck inside players not following with the custom animations of the custom player model

*   The warning for a cube having 0 UV width and height has been made more verbose, and will also be dependent on the `floor UVs` setting in earlier versions.

*   fixed a crash when arrows render stuck inside a player with a custom model that replaced all their vanilla parts
*   fixed arrows stuck inside players not following with the custom animations of the custom player model
*   EMF now removes the `floor UVs` OptiFine parity setting in 1.21 and newer versions, as OptiFine now matches EMF's default behaviour.
