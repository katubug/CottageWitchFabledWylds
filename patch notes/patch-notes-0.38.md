CraftPresence Changes
=====================

v2.5.1 (10/08/2024)
-------------------

_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is available [here](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence%252f-%252fcompare%252frelease%252fv2.5.0...release%252fv2.5.1)_

See the Mod Description or [README](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.

### Changes

*   (Backend) Updated Build Dependencies (Please see the appropriate repositories for changes)
    *   Unimined (`1.3.4` -> `1.3.9`)
    *   JVMDowngrader (`1.0.0` -> `1.1.3`)
    *   Shadow (`8.1.8` -> `8.3.0`)
    *   ClassGraph (`4.8.174` -> `4.8.177`)
    *   UniLib (`1.0.1` -> `1.0.3`)
    *   Fabric Loader (`0.15.11` -> `0.16.5`)
    *   Gradle (`8.9` -> `8.10.2`)
    *   Shadow (`8.3.0` -> `8.3.3`)
    *   JUnixSocket (`2.10.0` -> `2.10.1`)
    *   DiscordIPC (`0.10.0` -> `0.10.1`)
*   Added a new `useClassLoader` option in `Advanced` settings
    *   This setting only effects the results of `FileUtils#loadClass` when using certain reflection functions while creating RPC placeholders
    *   This option will reset to its default when transferring a config to a new Minecraft Version
    *   This option defaults to `true` if below Java 16, and `false` otherwise
*   Added `ServerData` refresh support to `Server` module
    *   This allows the module's current server data to be pinged every once in a while, depending on the new config settings `pingRateInterval` and `pingRateUnit`
    *   The Defaults allow for one ping every 5 minutes while in a server, allowing `ServerData` to remain up-to-date
    *   This additionally improves the `ServerData` behaviors of Direct Connections and Join Requests

### Fixes

*   Removed the `quilted_fabric_api` requirement from Quilt Jars
    *   Dependencies are now JIJd the same way as Fabric Jars are
*   Fixed an issue where `data.general.time` would constantly update if `resetTimeOnInit` was `true`
    *   Bug originally occurred in v2.4.0 from a commit regression

* * *

### More Information

#### Known Issues

Despite configuration compatibility often being ensured between versions, caution is advised to ensure the best experience, while also baring in mind that features can be adjusted, removed, or added/iterated upon between releases.

Please refer to the Mod Description or [README](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence) to view more info relating to known issues.

#### Snapshot Build Info

Some Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.

Any Snapshot Build released will be marked as **ALPHA** to match its Snapshot Status depending on tests done before release and issues found.

Snapshot Builds, depending on circumstances, may also contain changes for a future version of the mod, and will be noted as so if this is the case with the `-Staging` label.

### [Forge 1.20.2] CraftPresence v2.5.0
CraftPresence Changes
=====================

v2.5.0 (08/08/2024)
-------------------

_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is available [here](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence%252f-%252fcompare%252frelease%252fv2.4.3...release%252fv2.5.0)_

See the Mod Description or [README](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.

### Changes

*   (Backend) Updated Build Dependencies (Please see the appropriate repositories for changes)
    *   Unimined (`1.2.14` -> `1.3.4`)
    *   JVMDowngrader (`0.7.2` -> `1.0.0`)
    *   Shadow (`8.1.7` -> `8.1.8`)

    *   UniLib (`local` -> `1.0.1`)
    *   DiscordIPC (`0.9.2` -> `0.10.0`)
*   Several packaging changes have been made for ease-of-access and for future development:
    *   Added publishing support for [Nightbloom](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fnightbloom.cc%252fproject%252fcraftpresence)
    *   Re-Added support for [OG Forge](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252ffiles.minecraftforge.net%252f) for MC 1.20.2+ Users
    *   Added support for Flint Loader for MC 1.21
    *   Deployed files are now split per-loader, rather than as one "fused" jar per MC version
    *   [UniLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unilib) is now a required dependency
*   Removed several config options that were not applicable to CraftPresence or were redundant metadata:
    *   From `main`: `_README`, `_SOURCE`
    *   From `accessibility`: `tooltipBackground`, `tooltipBorder`, `guiBackground`, `altGuiBackground`, `renderTooltips`
*   Moved `Party Privacy` setting from `General` to `Presence Editor (PresenceData)`
    *   This makes this setting an instance property instead of a global setting
    *   Due to the changes behind this method, this property is also reset to its default
*   Improved LAN support for the `server` module
    *   Several fixes have been made for "hosting" LAN servers alongside fixes for LAN in general
    *   This also effects Essential Mod support, given the similar networking tech involved
*   Added an RPC Visualizer to the `Presence Editor` and `Display Settings` Screens
    *   Replicates the look and feel of Discord's Visualizer, allowing users an "at-a-glance" preview of their RPC before saving
    *   Only displays if `Use As Main` is enabled or is the Default Module
    *   Can be disabled with the `Strip Extra Gui Elements` setting in `Accessibility`
*   Added support for Discord Activity Types
    *   Reference: [GitHub](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/pull/7033)
*   Misc. Optimizations and Performance Improvements across several APIs
    *   A large portion of CraftPresence's APIs have now branched off into [UniLib](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fUniLib), now being served as a required dependency for CraftPresence
    *   Many fixes and tweaks have been made over the last few months to make these APIs more usable for the public with better reliability and stability, especially on older versions of Minecraft
*   (Backend) Adjusted `ShadowJar` relocation paths to avoid mod conflicts

### Fixes

_A portion of these fixes are related to API functions that have been transferred to [UniLib](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fUniLib)_

*   (Backend) Fixed `Config#transferFrom` not properly considering flag data (Schema, MC Version, etc.)
    *   This regression could cause config corruption, esp. when using the `HypherConverter` or `KeyConverter`
*   (Backend) Fixed the `RAW_TRANSLATOR` not setting the proper `stripFormatting` flags
*   Fixed `enabled` and `visible` state discrepancies on various UI Text Widgets
*   Fixed issues where Slot List scrolling was inconsistent on some Legacy MC versions compared to others
*   Fixed an issue in the BTA port where weather retrieval was not properly working
*   Fixed inconsistent world data retrieval on some Legacy MC versions compared to others
*   Fixed [an issue](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fgitlab.com%252fCDAGaming%252fCraftPresence%252f-%252fissues%252f224) where a crash can occur while registering Translation Listeners
*   Fixed potential issues where `server.players.current` could be above `server.players.max`
*   (Backend) Fixed issues relating to text going off-screen with some `ScrollableTextWidget` elements
    *   Effected the `Advanced` and `Presence Editor` UIs

* * *

## Create Encased
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-encased)

### CreateCasing-1.20.1-1.6.2.jar
*   Belts can be encased with copper, train, creative casings & industrial iron block
    
    *   Particles are buged, I know I don't find how to fix them
*   New configs to :
    
    *   Dis/Enable the swap of casing between different blocks (mixer, press...)
    *   Dis/Enable the swap of types of wood & materials (Wood types, andesite alloy, brass, glass...) between different blocks (shaft,cogwheel and large cogwheel)

****Other infos****

Some people will ask why I didn't make a release for 1.18.2 and 1.19.2, I have two reasons for this, the first is the time it takes to make backport for 1.18.2 & 1.19.2, the second reason is to stay aligned with the [Development status of Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status), I know that some people still uses 1.18.2 & 1.19.2 but I don't have the time to make backport. Also I know that the dev status indicates that 1.18.2 & 1.19.2 are still in 0.5.1 but I wait for 0.5.2/0.6 to make bigger update and rewrite. Fixes can be release on 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 but bigger features will stay on 1.20.1

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

    *   The archivesName property of BasePluginExtension is a Property<String>.
    *   The default implementation of toString() for a Property is to print out
    *   their name and owning object, and not the toString() of their contents.
    *   This meant that passing archivesName to Node#appendNode as a value,
    *   which calls toString() on it to make it into a String, results in e.g.
    *   `extension 'base' property 'archivesName'` instead of the expected
    *   value of e.g. `jei-1.19-common-api`.
    *   The simple fix is to call Property#get() on archivesName to get its
    *   actual value and pass that on as the node value.

## Iris & Oculus Flywheel Compat
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iris-flywheel-compat)

### Forge 1.20.1+1.1.3b-beta
**This version only compatible with Iris&Oculus 1.7.0 and above.**

TL;DR:

*   Fix issues in **PBR** and **Parallax Occlusion Mapping**.
*   Support **Seus PTGI HRR 3**, **Shrimple**, and **UShader**, etc.
*   Includes Flywheel in the jar file, so you don't need to install it separately.

### 1.1.3

*   Fix issue [#146](https://github.com/leon-o/iris-flw-compat/issues/146).
    *   Fix issues in PBR. Normals and tangents of moving contraptions now are correct.
    *   Support Parallax Occlusion Mapping.
*   Fix issue [#150](https://github.com/leon-o/iris-flw-compat/issues/150).
    *   Replace `vertex v` with `vertex _flw_v` to avoid conflict with existing variables.
*   Include Flywheel in jar file.
    *   Because some users don't use the Create mod and have trouble with the Flywheel installation, I decided to include it in the jar file.

**New compatible shaders**:

*   Seus PTGI HRR 3
*   Shrimple
*   UShader

There are still many that have not been tested but may be compatible.

## The Bumblezone (NeoForge/Forge)
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-bumblezone-forge)

### The Bumblezone v7.5.1 (1.20.1 MC Forge)
### **(V.7.5.1 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### Structures:

Fixed it so Gazebuzz Cluster structure pulls random music discs to spawn from `the_bumblezone:structures/gazebuzz_cluster_music_discs` item tag instead of the `the_bumblezone:structures/dance_floor_music_discs` item tag

Removed the floating honey inside Goliath Honey Fountain. No idea how the heck that snuck in while saving pieces of the fountain.

#### Entities:

Rootmins can be "tamed" by using a Name Tag on them. Once they are owned by a player, the Rootmin will not shoot that player but will shoot at other players without bee armor. Owned Rootmins will also now shoot at any monster not owned by the Rootmin's owner and the monster is not tagged `the_bumblezone:rootmin/forced_do_not_target`

#### Fluids:

Fixed a case where Honey Fluids didn't render a side while falling. Also fixed still textures being too large when viewed through glass.

Falling Honey Fluid does not get squished textures now.

### **(V.7.5.0 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### Advancements:

Fixed issue where completing Honey Drunk advancement with 1 Honey Bottle in hand will replace the Royal Jelly Bottle reward with the Honey Bottle's Glass Bottle remainder.

Added a new advancement to show that you can sleep in beds within Bumblezone to set respawn point and beds won't explode!

Fixed Music Disc Collection advancement not requiring all Bumblezone Music Discs

#### Blocks:

Fixed Luminescence Wax Channel block's top and bottom texture not rotated when sword/shear right-clicked while horizontal.

Fixed Bee pattern Carvable Wax facing the wrong way when facing north, south, east, or west.

Fixed issue where untranslated enchantments are put at bottom of Crystalline Flower's list of enchantments.

Added a sorting button to Crystalline Flower's screen.

Fixed bug where tier 1 Crystalline Flower only showed enchantments whose level 2 min cost is within tier 1 range. Kept the bug for vanilla enchantments so some enchantments only begin to show up in tier 2 flower for a little bit of balance.

Fixed issue where Crystalline Flower would show treasure Enchantments that are not random loot table or enchanting table drops.

Heavy Air block now disables the ability to climb blocks. Mostly to stop Origins and other mods allowing people to climb walls easily to cheese Essence Events in Sempiternal Sanctums.

Fixed Honey Fluid rendering bottom of top Honey Fluid incorrectly when inside the bottom fluid.

#### Enchantments:

Allow Comb Cutter to now go up to Level 2 for faster mining. By default, Level 2 won't show in vanilla Enchanting Table. But you can get it from max tier Crystalline Flower or by combining two level 1 Comb Cutters together.

#### Effects:

Increased the default config value for the duration of Protection of the Hive. Now protection lasts 5 minutes when obtained by feeding Bees or feeding Honeycomb Brood blocks. Anyone with pre-existing config files would need to edit `howLongProtectionOfTheHiveLasts` to 6000 to match the new default value.

#### Entities:

Made beehemothSpeed config be synced from server to client, so it takes full effect without needing client to change value to match server. (Still need a restart for config value to take effect)

Changed the vehicle move speed check on server to now allow even higher Beehemoth speeds without getting speed checked by the server.

Removed Leaves tag from tier 1 Bee Queen trades.

Made Cosmic Crystal Entity in White Sempiternal Sanctum now target tiny players better for horizontal laser attack.

Made Cosmic Crystal Entity in White Sempiternal Sanctum no longer reset their attack phase when a crystal is destroyed/enough damage is done.

If the White Sempiternal Sanctum event is being beaten far too quickly, the Cosmic Crystals will get a shield and be impervious to all damage for a limited time. Wait for the shield to disappear and resume your attacks!

Rootmins will target smaller players better now when shooting Dirt Pellets.

Green Sempiternal Sanctum's event Rootmin will now have a shield showing when no player is on the other platform. Once a player is on platform, then the shield disappears and Rootmin can be damaged by any Dirt Pellet.

Green Sempiternal Sanctum's event Rootmin that knocks off armor with its Dirt Pellet will now make the dropped item never despawn.

Green Sempiternal Sanctum's event Rootmin's second phase will stagger the Dirt Pellets to make hitting back a bit better.

Made Yellow Sempiternal Sanctum's Electric Ring have a slightly bigger hitbox and spawns at a more fair heights in last 50% of the event.

Fixed Rootmins not hiding when in Heavy Air.

Fixed wild/wandering Beehemoths not wandering in Heavy Air.

Variant Bees can breed with normal Bees now but 1/4th chance of having a Variant Bee baby.

Fixed Honey Slime spawning stuck in blocks and suffocating.

#### Items:

Made Buzzing Briefcase no longer burnable in Furnace so that Modern Industrial no longer shows an EU energy tooltip on the item. Reduces confusion.

All endgame essence items now won't decrement their ability use counter if user is in Creative or Spectator mode.

#### Structures:

Added Gazebuzz Cluster structure to replace half of Hanging Gardens structure! This large structure made of many hanging gazebos will test your parkour skills and have a variety of stuff to grab! Including Crystalline Flower and Bee Armor!

Added Goliath Honey Fountain that can spawn in any Bumblezone biome! This a massive fountain of honey with secret entrance to the insides! Explore!

Added Mite Fortress as a very difficult and deadly structure with good loot! It is the battleground where Bees are struggling to fend off the endless waves of Endermites invading the dimension! Fight your way through Silverfish and Endermites for resources!

Added Phantasm Aviary as a hanging structure full of Phantoms along with Crystalline Flower and some loot! Has some Rootmins as well usually. This structure was originally made by Biban_Auriu with vanilla blocks so special thanks to them for donating this structure to this mod and letting us re-theme it!

Red Sempiternal Sanctum's arena event now has it own music! Beenna Box by Punpudle! Also a Music Disc was made for it!

Removed Cell Maze as a possible structure to locate from Pirate Ship's Honey Compass.

Removed End Rods and replace Purpur Block with Purpur Slabs in Cell Maze's End Bleed Room. Better balancing in packs by removing these two blocks that are used in some mod's endgame recipes.

Replaced the End Rods with Magenta Candles in Subway's Endermite End Piece.

Made Pyro The Burning Bee now have infinite Fire Resistance.

Split the tiny structures out of the main structure set into their own set of small structures. Will make exploration structures much more common in Bumblezone, so it is less barren.

Made Bee House and Stinger Spear Shrine not spawn in Hive Wall, Hive Pillar, or Pollinated Pillar biomes.

Spawn Candle Parkour structure in Crystal Canyon biome now.

Split Stinger Spear Shrine, Bee House, Honey Fountain, and Candle Parkour into multiple pieces, so it terraform terrain around itself in a circular look instead of square look. Meshes better with terrain as a result.

Split Battle Cube and Sempiternal Sanctum structures into multiple pieces for much faster generation during worldgen.

Fixed Luminescence Wax facing wrong way in several rooms in Sempiternal Sanctums.

Fixed Carvable Wax Pillars not reaching low ceilings in Sempiternal Sanctums.

Fixed int overflow with my `min_distance_from_world_origin` option in structure sets. Was preventing structures from spawning at certain areas of the world beyond world center area. You should no longer see Sempiternal Sanctums like 9k away anymore. This means more Sanctums (and more Throne Pillars) are now spawning.

Spawn Honey Cave Room structure farther from sea level.

#### Mod Compat:

Add more mod compat Bee Queen Trades and tagging! Special thanks to Cicopath for the work here!
